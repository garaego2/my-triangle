Board, Game, Piece and PiecesStack have been created, with some methods implemented, for example, methods: isEmpty and isFull in Board and position, coords and samePiece in Piece. Struggling a little bit with the addPiece, but it is coming along.

More progress with the classes. Done research about what library to use in the GUI. Updated methods for Piece and PiecesStack. 
PiecesStack is pretty much ready and file operations file created. More methods in Board.

GUI is pretty much done, only thing left is testing and adding png of the puzzle pieces.
